# road_budget_road_deaths
Studying the impact of amount invested by Government on roads vs the Death count caused by Road Accidents under varying unemployment and car sales.

Abstract
Road accidents are one of the major causes of unexpected deaths. Although some crashes are minor, some are gruesome and lead to horrific results. The cause of road accidents is often linked to poor quality of roads. This is because roads bear a lot of wear and tear all year round- under changing environmental conditions and traffic flowing across all the time. The result is damaged roads, often with unevenness or potholes- a big cause of road accidents. Governments across the globe, have realised the importance of good roads, and invest a huge chunk of their budgets each year on their development and maintenance.
Hence there is a need to study about what impact, if any, the huge amount invested by Governments has on the accidents that lead to deaths.
We select 3 countries-Canada, France and Australia, because they are among the top 10 countries that have the highest number of highways in the world [1].
We find out the quartile in which each Death Count of these countries falls compared to that of 53 countries each year. We also include variations in ‘Unemployment’ and ‘Percentage change of the number of Car Registrations’ in our study. The study is observed during a 20-year span: 1994-2013.
